# 628Groupwork1 Deadline: Feb 4

Github Repository and Contents
Your group must publish a Github repository that contains all of the data analysis. The repo should consist of three parts:

  (i) a data folder containing the raw and (if relevant) cleaned data,

  (ii) a code folder containing all the code for your analysis (e.g. cleaning the data, running the analysis, producing figures/tables, etc.),

  (iii) an image folder containing any figures/images/tables produced in your analysis.

Additionally, the repository must contain

  (a) an executive summary folder/file containing a Jupyter Notebook file which must be readable by the Chrome web browser and

  (b) a README Markdown file briefly summarizing the contents of the repository.

Your repository must include all figures/tables, equations, code, and references. All figures, tables, code, and text must be legible. In particular, code must be clean enough for a data scientist to read.

On the summary, the group must clearly indicate each member's contribution to the project, including each member's contribution to the presentation, code, and the image files. The final summary should not exceed more than 6 pdf pages.
